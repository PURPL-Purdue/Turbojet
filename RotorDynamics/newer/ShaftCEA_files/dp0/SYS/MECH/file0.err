 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.969   TIME= 23:06:11
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.547   TIME= 23:06:11
 It has been detected that you are using reduced integration brick       
 elements along with the PCG solver (EQSLV,PCG).  Please verify that     
 you have multiple elements through the thickness in your model or       
 switch to the SPARSE solver (EQSLV,SPARSE).                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.234   TIME= 23:06:11
 Material property EX of material 1 of element 158 is evaluated at a     
 temperature of 22, which is below the supplied temperature range.       
 Temperature range checking terminates.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.781   TIME= 23:06:13
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.797   TIME= 23:06:13
 Certain contact elements (for example 46451 & 41792) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.797   TIME= 23:06:13
 Certain contact pairs (for example 249 & 215) overlap with other.       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.578   TIME= 23:06:16
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 1 of        
 contact node 20751.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.     
 Please check the model carefully.
